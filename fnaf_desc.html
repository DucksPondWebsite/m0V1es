            <h1>Five Nights at Freddy's</h1>
            <p>Five Nights at Freddy's is a supernatural horror film based on the video game series of the same name created by Scott Cawthon. Directed by Emma Tammi, the film follows Mike (Josh Hutcherson), a troubled young man caring for his younger sister Abby (Piper Rubio), who takes a job as a night security guard at an abandoned theme restaurant: Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. As Mike starts his job, he soon discovers that nothing at Freddy's is what it seems. With the aid of Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail), a local police officer, Mike's nights at Freddy's lead him into unexplainable encounters with the supernatural and drag him into the black heart of an unspeakable nightmare.</p>
